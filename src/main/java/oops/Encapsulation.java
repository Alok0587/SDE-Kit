/*
  Also called data hiding, is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts.
  Encapsulation is a way to hide data and methods within a class, restricting access from outside the class.
  This is typically done by declaring class variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods to
  access and modify those variables.

  Encapsulation helps to protect the integrity of the data by preventing unauthorized access and modification.
  It also promotes modularity and maintainability by allowing changes to the internal implementation of a class
  without affecting the external code that uses the class.


  Example-

   public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter for name
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter for name
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    // Setter for age
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
